So I've been fiddling with the numbers all day and I've discovered it's the Distribution  in combonation with the Geometric 
term that's causing it to appear black.  The first one will rid the model of all color and the second term will cause 
half the model to black out.

I don't know how I could have fixed that, seeing as all the math I've pulled from all the various sources was all the same
fourmula.  If you want I can pull a list of sites where I pulled the info from

I'm pretty sure it should look simalar to the simple Spec+Diffuse+Ambient that's on the shader labeled CGTesting(Working) 
but render just using different math. I've left it commented out for now so you see what it should look like right now

Like I said, I don't know what's wrong with it, and only one person knows my pain, but he figured it himself and didn't 
feel like sharing with the rest of the world how he did it.
